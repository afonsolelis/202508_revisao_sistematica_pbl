# Abstract

Project-Based Learning (PBL) has become a prominent pedagogical approach in higher education, particularly in STEM disciplines, offering significant benefits for developing technical and transversal competencies. However, assessing student learning in PBL environments presents unique challenges for educators, including evaluating individual contributions within collaborative teams, measuring processual competencies, and providing continuous feedback throughout extended project timelines. This systematic literature review analyzes 179 articles published between 2015 and 2025 to map the current state of research on assessment challenges in PBL contexts and identify methodological difficulties, instruments, and technologies used to address these challenges. The review reveals that while programming tools dominate the current technology landscape (67.0%), critical emerging technologies such as Digital Twins (0.6%) and automated assessment systems (0.6%) remain underexplored. Traditional assessment methods predominate (58.1%), with advanced approaches like automated assessment (3.4%) and learning analytics (0.6%) significantly underutilized. Key challenges identified include processual assessment, collaborative competency evaluation, transversal skill measurement, and scalability issues. The review identifies significant research gaps, particularly in the application of architecture-based approaches to educational assessment systems and the integration of real-time support technologies for instructors. These findings suggest opportunities for future research in leveraging emerging technologies to develop more effective, scalable, and fair assessment approaches for PBL environments.
