# Project Restructuring Summary: Systematic Review on PBL Assessment Challenges

## Background

This project was initially set up with a mismatch between its stated focus and implemented search strategy. The filtering criteria document (`criterios_filtragem_aproximacao.md`) correctly identified the research focus as "assessment challenges in Project-Based Learning," but the search strategy and implementation were oriented toward "Digital Twins in educational environments."

## Actions Taken

### 1. Clarified Research Focus
We confirmed that the project should focus on **assessment challenges in Project-Based Learning**, addressing the four key research questions:
1. What are the main methodological challenges in assessing learning in PBL contexts?
2. What instruments and technologies are being used to overcome these challenges?
3. How can technology support more objective and scalable assessment in PBL?
4. What gaps persist in assessing processual and collaborative competencies?

### 2. Redesigned Search Strategy
Created new search strings aligned with the PBL assessment focus:
- Core search terms focused on PBL + assessment + challenges
- Specific strings for each research question
- Maintained Web of Science as the primary database

### 3. Updated Analysis Tools
Modified the RIS analyzer script (`ris_analyzer.py`) to:
- Include keywords aligned with assessment challenges
- Add categories for instruments, technology, and collaborative assessment
- Update the relevance criteria to match our research questions

### 4. Organized Project Structure
- Archived misaligned files in a separate directory
- Created new protocol document (`protocolo_revisao_sistematica.md`)
- Developed execution plan (`plano_execucao_revisao.md`)
- Updated search strings document (`strings_busca_alinhadas.md`)

### 5. Validated Approach
Ran the updated analyzer on existing data:
- Analyzed 990 articles from 11 RIS files
- Identified 322 relevant articles (32.5% selection rate)
- Confirmed the approach captures literature aligned with our focus

## Current Project Status

The project is now properly aligned with its intended focus on PBL assessment challenges. All components have been restructured to support this research direction.

## Next Steps

Following the execution plan (`plano_execucao_revisao.md`):

1. **Weeks 1-2**: Finalize protocol and set up tools
2. **Weeks 3-6**: Execute database searches and study selection
3. **Weeks 7-10**: Extract data and assess quality
4. **Weeks 11-14**: Synthesize findings
5. **Weeks 15-16**: Write and disseminate results

## Key Files for Next Steps

1. **Protocol**: `protocolo_revisao_sistematica.md` - Complete systematic review protocol
2. **Search Strings**: `busca/strings_busca_alinhadas.md` - Database search terms
3. **Execution Plan**: `plano_execucao_revisao.md` - Detailed timeline and procedures
4. **Analysis Tool**: `ris_analyzer.py` - Updated script for article filtering
5. **Filtered Articles**: `busca/consolidado/artigos_relevantes_pbl_avaliacao.ris` - Relevant articles identified by the analyzer

## Recommendations for Moving Forward

1. **Team Training**: Ensure all team members understand the inclusion/exclusion criteria
2. **Pilot Testing**: Test the selection process with a small sample before full implementation
3. **Regular Check-ins**: Schedule weekly meetings to monitor progress and address issues
4. **Documentation**: Maintain detailed records of all decisions for transparency and reproducibility
5. **Quality Control**: Regularly review data extraction for consistency and accuracy

This restructuring has positioned the project for success in addressing the important topic of assessment challenges in Project-Based Learning.
