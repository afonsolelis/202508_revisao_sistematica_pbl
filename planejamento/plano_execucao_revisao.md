# Plan for Conducting the Systematic Review on PBL Assessment Challenges

## Phase 1: Preparation and Organization (Weeks 1-2)

### 1.1 Finalize Protocol
- [ ] Review and finalize the systematic review protocol
- [ ] Register the protocol in an appropriate registry (e.g., PROSPERO)
- [ ] Confirm inclusion/exclusion criteria with team members

### 1.2 Set Up Tools and Infrastructure
- [ ] Select reference management software (e.g., Zotero, Mendeley)
- [ ] Set up data extraction forms (electronic templates)
- [ ] Prepare quality assessment tools (appropriate for study designs)
- [ ] Create shared workspace for team collaboration

### 1.3 Team Training
- [ ] Train team members on inclusion/exclusion criteria
- [ ] Practice study selection with sample articles
- [ ] Calibrate quality assessment procedures

## Phase 2: Study Identification and Selection (Weeks 3-6)

### 2.1 Database Search Execution
- [ ] Execute search strategy in Web of Science
- [ ] Export search results in RIS format
- [ ] Remove duplicates using reference management software

### 2.2 Title and Abstract Screening
- [ ] Screen titles and abstracts against inclusion criteria
- [ ] Document reasons for exclusion
- [ ] Calculate inter-rater reliability (Cohen's Kappa) for a sample
- [ ] Resolve disagreements through discussion

### 2.3 Full-Text Retrieval
- [ ] Retrieve full texts of potentially eligible studies
- [ ] Update references as needed

### 2.4 Full-Text Assessment
- [ ] Apply inclusion/exclusion criteria to full texts
- [ ] Document reasons for exclusion
- [ ] Calculate inter-rater reliability for full-text screening
- [ ] Resolve disagreements through discussion or third reviewer

## Phase 3: Data Extraction and Quality Assessment (Weeks 7-10)

### 3.1 Data Extraction
- [ ] Extract data from included studies using standardized forms
- [ ] Pilot extraction form with a sample of studies
- [ ] Refine form as needed
- [ ] Extract data on:
  - Study characteristics (authors, year, journal, country)
  - PBL context (subject area, educational level, project duration)
  - Assessment approaches (methods, instruments, technologies)
  - Challenges identified
  - Solutions proposed
  - Outcomes and findings

### 3.2 Quality Assessment
- [ ] Assess risk of bias for each included study
- [ ] Use appropriate tools based on study design
- [ ] Document quality assessment results
- [ ] Consider quality in synthesis

## Phase 4: Data Synthesis and Analysis (Weeks 11-14)

### 4.1 Descriptive Analysis
- [ ] Characterize the body of evidence
- [ ] Analyze temporal trends
- [ ] Map geographical distribution
- [ ] Identify most common study designs

### 4.2 Thematic Analysis
- [ ] Identify key themes related to assessment challenges
- [ ] Categorize instruments and technologies by function
- [ ] Map solutions to specific challenges
- [ ] Identify gaps in the literature

### 4.3 Narrative Synthesis
- [ ] Describe patterns in the literature
- [ ] Explain relationships between concepts
- [ ] Highlight contradictions and gaps
- [ ] Address how findings relate to research questions

## Phase 5: Reporting and Dissemination (Weeks 15-16)

### 5.1 Manuscript Writing
- [ ] Write systematic review manuscript following PRISMA guidelines
- [ ] Include PRISMA flow diagram
- [ ] Create tables summarizing study characteristics
- [ ] Prepare figures illustrating key findings

### 5.2 Peer Review
- [ ] Internal review by team members
- [ ] Revise based on feedback
- [ ] External review if applicable

### 5.3 Submission and Dissemination
- [ ] Submit to appropriate peer-reviewed journal
- [ ] Prepare conference presentations
- [ ] Plan knowledge translation activities

## Resource Requirements

### Human Resources
- Principal investigator (lead)
- 2-3 research assistants
- 1 methodologist/statistician (for consultation)
- 1 subject matter expert (education assessment)

### Technical Resources
- Reference management software license
- Data extraction and analysis software
- Cloud storage for collaborative work
- Access to institutional library databases

### Financial Resources
- Potential costs for open access publication
- Conference presentation fees (if applicable)

## Risk Management

### Potential Risks and Mitigation Strategies

1. **Incomplete Literature Capture**
   - Mitigation: Use multiple search terms, check reference lists of included studies

2. **Low Inter-Rater Reliability**
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive training, clear criteria, regular calibration

3. **Publication Bias**
   - Mitigation: Search for grey literature, use funnel plots if meta-analysis is possible

4. **Time Constraints**
   - Mitigation: Realistic timeline, regular progress monitoring, flexible scheduling

5. **Team Availability**
   - Mitigation: Clear role assignments, backup personnel, regular communication

## Quality Assurance

### Monitoring and Evaluation
- Weekly team meetings to track progress
- Monthly progress reports to supervisor
- Regular quality checks on data extraction
- Peer review of preliminary findings

### Documentation
- Maintain detailed logs of all decisions
- Document reasons for study exclusion
- Record quality assessment results
- Archive all materials for reproducibility

## Ethical Considerations

As this is a literature review, no primary data collection from human subjects is involved. All data will be handled in accordance with academic integrity standards.
