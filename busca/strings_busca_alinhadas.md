# Search Strings Aligned with PBL Assessment Challenges

## Research Questions Alignment

### RQ1: What are the main methodological challenges in assessing learning in PBL contexts?
- Focus: Assessment challenges, methodological issues, process evaluation

### RQ2: What instruments and technologies are being used to overcome these challenges?
- Focus: Assessment instruments, tools, technologies, rubrics, frameworks

### RQ3: How can technology support more objective and scalable assessment in PBL?
